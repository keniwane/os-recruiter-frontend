            <p>
              At my company, we hire all levels of employees and OSR is the only source we use. Posting positions are
              fine but this costs money and leaves us with more work, and in the end, we are about 50/50 for good
              long-term hires.

              Using Open Source Recruiter I never have to worry about filling hard to fill positions and the best part
              of this is we don't have to pay for expensive and noneffective listings. We even use OSR for a senior
              leadership role with great success!

              Finding the right candidates consumes a lot of time and money at our company. After utilizing Open Source
