            cultural fit for the position. We will create a custom social media kit, place targeted ads, and run the
            search data you provided into our proprietary system to start sourcing candidates. From there, our highly
            skilled recruiters will start the outreach with candidates. Our searches also reach a diverse and inclusive
            pool of candidates through our partnership with deiajobs.com.
